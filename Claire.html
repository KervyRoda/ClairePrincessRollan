            <p>Hi love, I know life can sometimes feel overwhelming and tough, but please remember that you're never alone. Whenever you feel down, know that I'm right by your side, holding your hand and walking with you through every challenge. You are stronger than you think, and I admire your strength every day. You have a heart full of love and kindness, and that makes you the most beautiful person I know.</p>

            <p>When the world feels heavy, let me be the one to lift some of that weight. Whatever you're going through, I'm here to listen, to support you, and to help you in any way I can. Together, we can face anything, and no matter what, you are loved beyond measure. Never forget that I am so proud of you, and I believe in you with all my heart.</p>

            <p>Your happiness means everything to me, and I want to be there for you, not just in the easy moments but in the hard ones too. If you ever feel unsure or lost, please come to me, because you are the most precious thing in my life. No matter what happens, we will get through it together.</p>

            <p>Take a deep breath, my love. You are enough, and I love you endlessly. üíñ</p>

        <h1>BAWIIIII KO DIRI LOVE</h1>
        <p>My Dearest Claire Princess Rollan, </p>
        

I want to start by saying how deeply sorry I am for my actions. I know I‚Äôve let you down, and for that, I am truly sorry. It hurts me to know that I‚Äôve caused you pain, and that‚Äôs the last thing I ever wanted. You deserve nothing but love, kindness, and respect, and I failed to give you that in that moment.

Please know that I am taking this to heart. I am committed to learning from my mistakes and becoming a better man‚Äîfor you, for us, and for myself. I want to be the person who lifts you up, who supports you in every way, and who makes you feel loved and valued every single day. I‚Äôm not perfect, but I promise to put in the effort to grow, to listen more, and to treat you with the care you truly deserve.

You are so incredibly important to me, and I never want to cause you hurt again. If you‚Äôll allow me the chance, I will prove to you that I can be better, for you, for us, and for our future.

I love you deeply, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. Thank you for your patience and understanding as I work to become the man you deserve.

With all my love,
[Kervy]</p>
